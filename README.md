# Latin declensions chart

Uses [PlotDevice](http://plotdevice.io).

To modify the order of the cases, just change the headings setting in `data.yaml`. To add a case (such as vocative), do this:

- Add it to the headings setting
- Add it to the declension data (same format as the others)
- Tweak spacing as necessary
